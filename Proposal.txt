Final Project Proposal

For my final project I wanted to get some experience with database design. The domain that I have selected is travel sales.
Using more advanced topics in SQL, I want to simulate the events that may occur when a customer decides to book their next vacation. 
I think this will be a great opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of SQL through hands on practice and obtain experience with database design to prepare for real world situations.

///////// Key Objective ///////////////////////

- This project will include a database design using Oracle Data modeler's forward and backward engineering process to generate related domain entities. 

- It will provide examples of how applications (both front and back end) can connect with sql database serversand interfact with different types of schema objects.

- Practice the use of advanced schema objects.

Sample work in progress DDL statements can be found in Definition.ddl file.
